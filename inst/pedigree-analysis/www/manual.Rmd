# Pedigree Analysis via Learning App pedana

### pedana

**pedana** (Syllabic abbreviation of <i><u>ped</u>igree <u>ana</u>lysis</i>) is
a learning app for practicing the analysis of pedigree problems.

* You can practice as long as you want.
* You will constantly get new tasks on all modes of inheritance.
* You can choose from 3 practice modes.
* You will receive a detailed feedback for your analysis.

### Aim of the Pedigree Analysis

A typical goal in pedigree analysis is to identify the mode of inheritance 
explaining the distribution of the outlined trait. In this regard, it is 
reasonable to stepwise exclude modes of inheritance that are incapable of 
explaining the observed distribution of the trait. This could be called 
a *strategy of stepwise falsification*. The app guides you to use this 
strategy in order to identify the present mode of inheritance.

### The app offers three practice modes:

* **Worked-Out Example**: Ideal for getting used to the app and how to build a good solution. You will be shown a complete worked-out example including detailed feedback.
* **Progressive Practice Mode**: You will receive multiple tasks in a row. The tasks will be partially filled. Complete the analysis and receive a detailed feedback on your input. The problems become gradually more open. You can edit your explanation twice per task.
* **Free Practice Mode**: Analyse a pedigree, create a complete explanation and get detailed feedback. You can edit your explanation twice per task.

### How the Analysis Works

* Analyse the pedigree.
* Insert your solution.
* Check your inputs by clicking the <i class='fa fa-check'></i> **Check button**.
* You will receive a short feedback on your solution.
* Edit your inputs by clicking the <i class='fa fa-edit'></i> **Edit button**.
* For the second revision, you will receive an elaborated feedback.
* After the second revision, you can edit your inputs once again.
* When checking the third time, you will receive a sample solution.

### Good Luck!
